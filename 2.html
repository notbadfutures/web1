    <p>The (well embellished) tale goes that Johnson was walking towards Rosedale in October, stopping at a crossroads at midnight where he met the devil. The devil’s dog appeared to be mad, making a low, rhythmic, soulful howl unlike anything Johnson had heard before. The devil told Johnson that he couldn’t have the dog, but he could have the sound, naming it the Delta Blues. Johnson didn’t hesitate, agreeing to sign over whatever he had. The devil said there was no need for paperwork, just the understanding that by continuing on to Rosedale he agreed to the terms that Johnson’s soul would no longer be his, but his music would possess all who heard it. “Step back, Devil-Man, I’m going to Rosedale. I am the blues.” And the deal was done.While the deal with the devil story is undoubtedly more exciting, Johnson himself claimed he’d simply been studying with a teacher while he was away. He liked practicing in graveyards because it’s quiet. It wasn’t just that he had mastered playing; to everyone’s surprise he had a seventh string on his guitar – something not previously seen in the blues scene. He had seemingly pioneered a whole new sound and way of playing, including unusual techniques like strumming a series of rapid-fire chords that made the guitar sound more like a piano. Barry Lee Pearson, folklorist, professors, and co-author of the book Robert Johnson: Lost and Found, explains the popular myth in a conversation with NPR. He says that because there was so little biographical information about Johnson available, and because a deal with the devil is more interesting than the truth – blues writers at the time were working harder to find details to corroborate the story than disprove it.
