    <p>The legend of Burzum and Varg Vikernes the man behind the influential black metal project, is more like the plot of a dark Scandinavian crime drama than real life. Vikernes served 15 years in prison for the murder of fellow black metal musician, Mayhem guitarist Øystein “Euronymous” Aarseth in 1993, as well as for the arson of three churches. Vikernes was signed to Euronymous’ label, Deathlike Silence Productions in the early ’90s. Euronymous had been impressed with Vikernes’ demos and the two had become friends. However, tensions between the two of them had been mounting after Vikernes had published an article in one of Norway’s biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende, under the pseudonym “Count Grishnackh”. In the article, “We Lit The Fires”, he claimed responsibility for a spate of church burnings and for killing a man in Lillehammer. He said the attacks would continue, carried out by himself and a group of devil worshippers intent on spreading fear and devilry. Euronymous felt he was forced to shutter his record shop, Helvete due to the increasing police and media attention following the article’s appearance.
