    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>In her new memoir, Face It, Debbie Harry tells a story from the early days of Blondie about how she narrowly avoided a potentially very fraught situation with a man she believes was Ted Bundy. It was a hot New York night in the summer of 1972 and was having trouble hailing a cab to get across town. A dude who was circling the neighbourhood in a white car stopped at the curb and offered her a ride. She thought about walking but was wearing big platforms and didn’t fancy the trek, so she got in out of desperation, and soon realised her mistake. The inside of the car was “totally stripped out” and she immediately felt in danger. Despite it being unbearably hot inside the car, the windows were wound all the way to the top. There were no door handles or window crank. Harry has said when he saw her trying to open the door he tried turning a corner really fast, which worked to her favour, helping to propel her out of the car and land her in the middle of the street.
